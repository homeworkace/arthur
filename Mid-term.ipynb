    "At first glance, the values in this column line up with the values as prescribed by the leftmost index column. There are a variety of parameters when using `pandas.DataFrame.to_csv()` to save a pandas DataFrame to `.csv`. If there is at least one column filled entirely with unique, non-empty values, `index_label` can be used to designate one of them as the index column. Otherwise, `index` can be used to influence whether a new column of indices is created. If an index-like column already exists in the DataFrame, but isn't designated as such, pandas will treat it like any other column, as it could contain real information. As the `Unnamed: 0` column seems to be a common enough phenomenon within datasets uploaded to Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/354943), I believe this is what happened in the creation of this dataset.\n",

However, apart from being highly unlikely that prices are denominated in anything other than dollars and cents, the smallest division of the US dollar is the cent, which is a hundredth of a dollar. Should the agreed-upon price contain part of a cent, buyers may find it hard to pay the exact amount.

    "## `artist`\n",
    "Some artists are more famous than others, and consistently command higher prices. Therefore, the provenance of a work should be a predictor of its price. To model this, I sought to turn this column into two features:\n",
    "  - Dummy (one-hot) encodings for prolific artists. The result is as many columns of dummy encodings as there are artists I wish to track. Any work would take a value of `1` on the column that represents its artist, and `0` everywhere else. The names for each of these columns shall be copied from the strings in `artist`.\n",
    "  - `works_by_artist`: The number of works in this dataset that are from the same artist. I hypothesised that even if a buyer was unfamiliar with a particular artist, the fact that an auction house's catalogue features many works from the same artist could give an impression of relevance, popularity or market confidence. The result is a numerical column.\n",
    "\n",
    "My main consideration was the variability introduced during data entry. Different works may have been catalogued decades apart, by different appraisers, who may or may not follow the prevailing formatting guides of their time. Auction houses somewhat mitigate this through authority control, using internal databases to reconcile pseudonyms, name changes (e.g., after marriage), and other variants of a creator’s identity. However, mismatches still arise, and many must be resolved by the curators'/buyers' understanding. For example, if a system doesn't have the right heuristics to link two identities together, it may consider two works, attributed to \"PICASSO\" and \"Pablo Picasso\" respectively, to be unrelated. It is up to the buyer to make that connection between the two names, and correctly identify that either of these works are just as valuable as the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that this dataset may contain legacy formatting and clerical inconsistencies, and considering that a heuristic approach would not fit within the amount of effort I expect in this section, I decided on human judgement as the most practical choice in consolidating artist names. So, I performed a manual pass to merge entries that were clearly intended to refer to the same person. First, I needed to grasp the space of possible data I needed to process.\n",

    "ChatGPT suggested that \"The Bohemians (After August Sander 1924)\", attributed to \"After Kota Ezawa\", was the work of an unnamed artist, who was reinterpreting Ezawa’s own interpretation of August Sander. However, I considered this unlikely. If The Bohemians had been made by someone else, I would expect that it was presented in a different condition than the other genuine Ezawas, be offered at a different price, or was at least dated later than them. But in all these respects it was similar to the other Ezawas. Most of the descriptive fields had a consistent format, if not outright identical, and appeared in adjacent index positions. This implied to me that they were catalogued at the same time and by the same appraiser.\n",

    "Still, I verified my assumptions with a manual search. Although the work has been made unavailable today, I found its [listing](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/_the-bohemians-after-august-sander-1924-from-the-history-of-photography-remix-3eed). Here, I saw that not only were the style and colour palette similar to the other Ezawas, the description, which is missing from the dataset as a field, also read:\n",

All works in the dataset that had been attributed to any of these variants were re-attributed to this canonical form.

While it is certain that this work was created by someone, the absence of a traceable or recognisable identity removes any potential authorship premium. From a buyer’s perspective, unknown authorship introduces uncertainty and eliminates the possibility of prior recognition, institutional validation, or reputational signalling. Even artists represented by a single work retain a non-zero probability of name recognition, whereas an unknown artist does not. For this reason, I treat the unknown artist as having zero name-based recognition. Any value attributed to this work must therefore arise from other observable characteristics, such as aesthetic qualities, condition, or alignment with prevailing trends.\n",

    "While `works_by_artist` sought to capture the effect of confidence derived from seeing many works from the same artist, individual artists carry their own reputations too. Just knowing that a work was created by a renowned artist can add to its perceived value. I sought to encode this aforementioned \"authorship premium\" by adding a column for each artist, denoting whether a work was attributed to them. This allows a model to learn the \"value\" of an artist's name, independent of the qualities and aesthetics of their works.\n",

    "Dummy variables like these are extremely sparse; a column corresponding to an artist with a single work would take the value 1 for exactly one row and 0 everywhere else. As such a feature carries no repeatable signal, its coefficient would be estimated from a single observation and would therefore primarily capture noise rather than a stable effect attributable to the artist’s reputation. Including hundreds of such sparse features would greatly increase the dimensionality of the dataset without providing meaningful predictive power, increasing the risk of overfitting. At the same time, I consider artist indicators to act as tags rather than numerical features. I'm not measuring the *Pavel Tchelitchew*-ness of a work just like I am the price or year of creation. Instead, if a work had been made by Pavel Tchelitchew, the value associated with the tag is added to its predicted price, like a bias. Under this reasoning, one-work artists account for 318 of the 754 works (42%), and excluding these tags from being learned would remove any possibility of modelling name-based effects for a large subset of works.\n",

    "This completes the first set of features that I had introduced in the beginning of the section: dummy encodings for prolific artists. `artist_attributions` is designed to be modular; the columns are ordered in descending artist representation, and leftmost columns represent artists who have the most works. Rather than permanently committing to a fixed subset of artist indicators, a selected subset of its columns will be appended to the dataset. `artist_attribution_thresholds`, as shown in cell 20, is a reference for how many of the columns to include for training. For example, if I only wanted to track artists with at least 5 works, I would look up `artist_attribution_thresholds[5 - 1]`, which gives me a value of 22. This means that I should only append the first 22 columns of `artist_attributions` for training. By progressively including more columns and therefore less represented artists, I hoped to find the balance between the comprehensive tracking of artists' values and the noisiness of the resulting artist tags.\n",

    "I acknowledge that the title of an artwork influences a prospective buyer. First impressions matter in a marketplace of many works, and an engaging title would help a particular piece stand out to them, rather than be glossed over. However, most titles are unique to a single work and there is no obvious ordinal or numerical structure. To use title as an input to a linear regression model would require transforming the text into a set of bag-of-words features, which, due to the small sample size and large word space, would result in high sparsity and greatly increase the risk of overfitting. Therefore, I decided to retain `title` for my reference, but exclude it from the set of predictive features.\n",

    "Although I trained with more features later on, I restricted the feature set in this section to numerical variables. Categorical features such as `artist_attributions`, `condition_conversion`, `period_features`, and `movement_features` were excluded, as they are both sparse and mutually exclusive. Most observations take the value 0, and the few non-zero values represent the binary presence of a feature, rather than the degree to which said feature is present. Furthermore, just like a work from one artist cannot be attributed to any other artist, the presence of a feature generally precludes the presence of other features. Given these properties, I believed that any statistical analysis could not be meaningfully interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made an exception for the `signed_features` set. Although these features are also binary, they differ in three important respects: they are substantially denser, they are not mutually exclusive, and they represent provenance-related signals derived from multiple, manual heuristic rules. Including these features provided two purposes: it allowed for an assessment of whether the text-to-signal conversion process produced statistically meaningful patterns, rather than noise. It also served as an experiment against my hypothesis as to whether other categorical features, being mostly ones and zeroes, could result in meaningful statistics."

    "The median asking price is \\\\$2,500, indicating that half of the works in the dataset sell for less than this value, while the remaining half account for prices extending up to \\\\$160,000. This asymmetry is further reflected in the extremely high skewness and kurtosis, which indicate a long right-tailed distribution driven by a small number of very expensive works. As a result, any regression model trained on raw prices is likely to be disproportionately influenced by a few features that distinguish these works from the majority. For the prospective buyer, such features may represent strong and actionable indicators of value, but the relatively small number of high-priced observations also increases the risk of noise. A log-transformation may rein in the right tail and allow a model to better balance the importance of both the cheap and expensive features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `works_by_artist` feature has a similar right-tailed distribution, with a median of 2 and a mean of approximately 3.38. Having found earlier that only 1 work had no known artist and therefore a value of zero, this indicates that most artists are represented by only one or two works in the dataset. The distribution is also influenced by a small number of highly prolific artists, bringing the mean over the median. However, this modest increase suggests that no single artist achieves widespread presence within the dataset. Out of 754 works, the average artist has 3.38 works, and the most prolific artist only has 17. In practical terms, given an online catalogue of all 754 works distributed across multiple pages, the expected number of works per artist is sufficiently low that repeated appearances of the same artist within a page are unlikely. As a result, any hypothesised effect whereby frequent artist representation alone drives higher prices may be less perceptible to buyers than other distinguishing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The year feature exhibits a negatively skewed distribution, with a median of 1990.5 and a mean of approximately 1988, indicating a concentration of works from more recent decades and a longer tail extending toward older periods. Although the full range spans over 170 years, the relatively modest standard deviation suggests that most works are clustered within a narrower temporal window centred around the late twentieth century. This recency bias may be partly explained by market dynamics, as older works have had more opportunities to be transacted and thus exit the auction market. Additionally, institutional and curatorial preferences likely favour modern and contemporary works, further contributing to the observed skew.\n",
    "# Visualisations\n",
    "## Correlation between `period` and `year`\n",
    "The initial hypothesis was that the categorical period label would not strongly constrain the stated year of a work. In particular, given that periods are stylistic rather than strictly chronological, it was expected that substantial overlap would exist between periods, reducing the usefulness of period as a temporal proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate this, a custom visualisation was constructed that preserves both individual observations and uncertainty in dating. Each artwork is represented by a vertical marker at its stated year, accompanied by a vertical line spanning its associated year_interval, capturing imprecision introduced by ranges such as “circa”, decades, or other approximate dating.\n",
    "Artworks are grouped horizontally by period, with a small random horizontal offset applied within each period bin to prevent overplotting and reveal density. Periods are ordered by median stated year to aid interpretability. Entries with missing or placeholder interval values were excluded to avoid distorting the visual scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach avoids aggregation (e.g. boxplots or summary statistics), allowing both overlap and spread to be assessed directly."

    "Contrary to the initial hypothesis, the visualisation shows that period labels align closely with the stated years of works. Each period occupies a largely distinct vertical band, with limited overlap between adjacent periods. The majority of year intervals fall well within the expected temporal bounds implied by their period labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some overlap exists—particularly between adjacent periods such as Modern and Post-War—this overlap is modest and primarily driven by works with broader year_interval ranges rather than misaligned stated years. The central clustering of year markers within each period indicates that uncertainty is typically local rather than spanning multiple periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that, despite being a categorical and stylistic descriptor, period encodes substantial chronological information. In practice, period labels act as a coarse but reliable temporal abstraction. The consistency between period and year implies that period may serve as a useful explanatory feature in downstream modelling, either as a categorical predictor or as contextual support for temporal features.\n",
